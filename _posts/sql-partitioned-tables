title:  Partitioned tables with a sliding window
categories: [Azure SQL Database]
excerpt: Azure SQL Database supports horizontal partitioning of table data for manageability and performance benefits as explained in the docs. Although most of this capability is explained and documented in various places (see the related content in the docs), this repository attempts to demonstrate how to work with partitioned tables and sliding windows using Azure resources for a specific example scenario.
