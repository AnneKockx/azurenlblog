excerpt: Debunking assumptions of running functions and Docker and Java

I don’t really want to re-iterate and focus on the fact that Microsoft loves Linux (whether it is about shipping a full linux kernel in Windows10 or supporting Linux Workloads on Azure or open sourcing PowerShell, VS Code or contributing to open source for that matter) You may think what this has got to know with Java & Azure Functions — nothing much really! But sometimes I get to hear that Azure does not support Java workloads as other clouds do, and I hope this post helps debunk that myth to some extent.
