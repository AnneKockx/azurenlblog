The steps to creating data science projects on azure! This series will cover technology, organization, roles, core concepts, and tips about how you can approach a data science project, the value of the cloud, and the specifics on how this can be implemented on Azure. 

The focus will be the Azure Machine Learning platform (my favorite product from Azure) but especially how this fits within a larger picture. Expect episodes covering concepts like compute, datasets, models, and more.

This series is my initiative (all opinions are my own not the views of my employer) and quarantine project. Hope you find some useful insights in here, and as always for more info you should check out the official Microsoft documentation and resources.
