excerpt: Hands-on lab with Azure IoT Edge
---

This instructional hands on lab is just for education purposes and it is a simple E2E scenario to get the audience familiar with the Azure IoT Edge components. It is an assembly of Azure docs and tutorials and the references are provided throughout the document. By the end of each task we will be providing some pointers for concepts that can be discussed with the audience, either as a wrap up, or an opening and background information before they complete the task.
