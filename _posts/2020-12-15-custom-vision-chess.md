title: Using CustomVision to recognize chess pieces in realtime
categories: [Data,AI]
excerpt: For a customer I was tasked to demonstrate the capabilities of Azure’s CustomVision platform. CustomVision allows people without any programming knowledge at all to create their own computer vision models, and even bring this in production in no time. To help truly envision what the CustomVision platform can do, I proposed we should try to make the demonstration happen in ‘real time’. Real time in this case means drawing the labels over the recognized objects within the timespan of seconds. In this blog post, I will demonstrate how simple it is to teach a CustomVision model to recognize different chess pieces. I will use my CustomVision RealTime toolkit, github repo here, to send the images to the CustomVision API.
