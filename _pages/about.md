We consider knowledge sharing as part of our work. Each have their own content, audience and channel. We also want to help people find our content and reshare it. Which is why this blog bundles the various pieces of knowledge in a central location. This is an overview of [users](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureNL/blob/master/users.md). Feel free to share comments and questions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/azurenlblog/issues).
